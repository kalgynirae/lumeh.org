### H3: The Sub-Heading

Consider the following code excerpt.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from __future__ import annotations
from random import choice
from typing import Any, Optional

def maybe_return_something() -> Optional[Any]:
    return random.choice(random.choice([[None], globals().values()]))
```

##### H5: Hardly even a heading any more


<blockquote cite="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Ethics_of_Belief">

A shipowner was about to send to sea an emigrant-ship. He knew that she was
old, and not over-well built at the first; that she had seen many seas and
climes, and often had needed repairs. Doubts had been suggested to him that
possibly she was not seaworthy. These doubts preyed upon his mind, and made
him unhappy; he thought that perhaps he ought to have her thoroughly
overhauled and refitted, even though this should put him to great expense.
Before the ship sailed, however, he succeeded in overcoming these melancholy
reflections. He said to himself that she had gone safely through so many
voyages and weathered so many storms that it was idle to suppose she would not
come safely home from this trip also. He would put his trust in Providence,
which could hardly fail to protect all these unhappy families that were
leaving their fatherland to seek for better times elsewhere. He would dismiss
from his mind all ungenerous suspicions about the honesty of builders and
contractors. In such ways he acquired a sincere and comfortable conviction
that his vessel was thoroughly safe and seaworthy; he watched her departure
with a light heart, and benevolent wishes for the success of the exiles in
their strange new home that was to be; and he got his insurance-money when she
went down in mid-ocean and told no tales.

What shall we say of him? Surely this, that he was verily guilty of the death
of those men. It is admitted that he did sincerely believe in the soundness of
his ship; but the sincerity of his conviction can in no wise help him, because
*he had no right to believe on such evidence as was before him*. He had
acquired his belief not by honestly earning it in patient investigation, but
by stifling his doubts. And although in the end he may have felt so sure about
it that he could not think otherwise, yet inasmuch as he had knowingly and
willingly worked himself into that frame of mind, he must be held responsible
for it.
