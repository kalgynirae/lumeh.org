# <span class=lumeh-name><span>L</span>umeh</span>, God of Light Bulbs

> Thomas Edward was quite smart,\
> But money had he none.\
> So quick was he to answer when\
> Zeus called and told him, “Son…
>
> “I’m having trouble reading books\
> In the middle of the night.\
> These lightning bolts burn holes right through;\
> I need a softer light.
>
> “I asked some other people too,\
> And when they weren’t enthused\
> I decided I’d give a prize\
> For whoever’s light I used.”
>
> Thomas thought it over,\
> Then gave Zeus his reply:\
> “I’ll make the best light ever made!\
> Well, at least, I’ll try.”
>
> So Thomas set to work at once,\
> To finish his design.\
> He thought a bulb would work well,\
> Since its shape was quite divine.
>
> He formed the bulb of lucid glass\
> And being satisfied\
> He took his only lightning bug\
> And sealed it inside.
>
> But Thomas had a nemesis\
> Of whom he did not know.\
> And thus that night he left his bulb\
> Unhidden from his foe.
>
> Next morning Thomas was distraught\
> When, at the break of dawn,\
> He saw his light bulb on the desk—\
> The lightning bug was gone.
>
> “My light bulb having been ruined,\
> Who knows what I shall do?”\
> The angry Thomas Edward said.\
> But Zeus replied, “I do.
>
> “You have failed my contest, sir,\
> And that being the case,\
> There’s only one thing left to do:\
> I must kill you with this mace.”
>
> Thomas Edward cowered with fear\
> And backed against a wall.\
> But mighty Zeus just stood and laughed\
> At his imminent downfall.
>
> Then <span class=lumeh-name><span>L</span>umeh</span>, God of Light Bulbs,\
> In a blinding flash of light\
> Appeared and said to Thomas,\
> “Now lemme make things right.”
>
> He stood before the mighty Zeus.\
> His eyes started to narrow.\
> And with a frail buzzing sound,\
> He began to brightly glow.
>
> Zeus’s eyes were blinded.\
> <span class=lumeh-name><span>L</span>umeh</span> was alight;\
> He suddenly exploded,\
> But Thomas was alright.
>
> Thomas looked with wonder,\
> For though <span class=lumeh-name><span>L</span>umeh</span> was defunct,\
> To Thomas Edward’s light bulb\
> A bright glowing was adjunct.
>
> So Zeus ordered his minions to\
> The prize to Thomas bestow.\
> And all light bulbs from that point forth\
> Produced a useful glow.
