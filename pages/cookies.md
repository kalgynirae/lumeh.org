# Cookies

**lumeh.org doesn’t use cookies**, but you can make your own! We suggest either Colin’s [classic chocolate-chip
recipe](/recipes/cookies/) known for its use of maple flavoring or [Chonklate Chip
Cookies](/recipes/chonklate-chip-cookies/) which imitate Levain Bakery’s famous cookies.

For more information about lumeh.org, see its [project page](/projects/lumeh.org/).
