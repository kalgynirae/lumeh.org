# Trebuchennis

**Trebuchennis** is just like [tennis] except each player brings one or two
[trebuchets] which he/she uses to serve the ball. The trebuchets may be
placed anywhere behind the baseline (see [tennis court lines]), but note that
many placements are undesirable because they impede the player. The trebuchets
should be easily movable since they will need to switch sides of the court with
their players.

## History

Trebuchennis was invented by Colin Chan in the [early twenty-first century]. No
games have been played as of 9 September 2014.
