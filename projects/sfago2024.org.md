# sfago2024.org

<a href="https://www.sfago2024.org/" target="_blank">sfago2024.org</a> is the website for the
2024 National Convention of the <a href="https://www.agohq.org/" target=_blank>American Guild of Organists</a>. Unlike the websites of past AGO
conventions, this is a completely static site which I designed and built using
<a href="https://www.getzola.org/" target=_blank>Zola</a>. It is hosted on GitHub Pages.

The source of the website is on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/sfago2024/www">sfago2024/www</a>
