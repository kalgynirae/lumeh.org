## *Let's Godot Swimming*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Let's Godot Swimming.ogg" src-flac="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Let's Godot Swimming.flac">

*April 2021:* The soundtrack for
[Pool Trouble](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/pool-trouble), a game I
made for Ludum Dare 48. The game is about getting to the deep end of a
multi-story swimming pool, and I used the [Godot game engine] to build it.

## *Plausible Geometry*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Plausible Geometry.ogg" src-flac="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Plausible Geometry.flac" video="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GcHz6Ycd61Y">

*December 2020:* I upgraded to the "All Plugins" edition of FL Studio during a
recent sale, and made this track to try out some of the new plugins. I tried to
make more use of syncopation to get a better groove, and I think it worked!

</l-music>


# 2018


## *Glimmering Pavement*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Glimmering Pavement.ogg" src-flac="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Glimmering Pavement.flac" video="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7F4IYSzUPmQ">

*February 2018:* I started writing this on my phone during the bus rides home
from work, and then moved to my usual computer workflow after I had a few ideas.
In lieu of a better animation, I've just done a screen capture of the playlist
in FL Studio.

</l-music>


# 2017


## *Swimming in Circles*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Swimming in Circles.ogg" src-flac="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Swimming in Circles.flac" video="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6lmSJVmlT4o">

*April 2017:* The soundtrack for
[Something's Fishy](https://github.com/kalgynirae/somethings-fishy), a game
I made for Ludum Dare 38.  I wrote this in about two hours, and then spent
an additional 20 minutes after the submission deadline adding an actual
ending and cleaning things up very slightly.  I'm pretty happy with how it
turned out given the time limit, but I don't think it's as good as my other
recent tracks.

</l-music>


# 2016


## *Storm in the Valley*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Storm in the Valley.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Storm in the Valley.mp3" video="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w1QXSNBtV1w">

*August 2016:* Based on the Gerudo Valley theme from Ocarina of Time. See the description
of the YouTube video for more information.

## *Battle in the Cathedral (Remastered)*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Battle in the Cathedral (Remastered).ogg" src-flac="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Battle in the Cathedral (Remastered).flac">

*October 2015:* I made the original *Battle in the Cathedral* using [LMMS](https://lmms.io/)
instead of FL Studio, but I was never quite happy with how the final mix
turned out. So I exported the individual instrument tracks and mixed them
again in FL Studio, yielding this.

</l-music>


## *Windmills... in Space!*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Windmills... in Space!.ogg" src-flac="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Windmills... in Space!.flac" video="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KvIuU1sofBY">

*February 2015:* Based on the Song of Storms theme from Ocarina of Time. See the description
of the YouTube video for more information.

<l-music src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - You're a Hero (Instrumental).mp3" src-flac="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - You're a Hero (Instrumental).mp3">

*January 2014:* for Whosical the Musical at SwampCon 2014. They didn't end up
using this one, though.

</l-music>


## *Capes and Crepes (Instrumental)*

<l-music src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Capes and Crepes (Instrumental).mp3" src-flac="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Capes and Crepes (Instrumental).flac">

*January 2014:* for Whosical the Musical at SwampCon 2014. This was a very
silly song about heros liking breakfast food. I was given the lyrics and then
wrote this.

</l-music>


# 2013


## *Food Cart*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Food Cart.ogg">

*July 2013:* for [Mideast Sidearm Hideaway].

</l-music>


## *Gravitational Conflict*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Gravitational Conflict.ogg">

*July 2013:* for [Mideast Sidearm Hideaway]. I finally finished the older track "battle music (rough draft)". I got a little
bit carried away with the chords toward the end of the saxophone solo, and then
the part after that references the melody and chords from "Black Hole" (but it's
kind of difficult to pick out).

</l-music>


## *Black Hole*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Black Hole.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Black Hole.mp3">

*July 2013:* for [Mideast Sidearm Hideaway]. The beginning of this track is intended to accompany a short (roughly 10
seconds) cutscene in which the black hole appears and steals some parts
from your ship. The remainder of the track is a background music loop for
the game's overworld.

</l-music>


## *Space*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Space.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Space.mp3" src-flac="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Space.flac">

*July 2013:* for [Mideast Sidearm Hideaway].

## *Can't Hold Us (instrumental backing track)*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Can't Hold Us (instrumental backing track).ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Can't Hold Us (instrumental backing track).mp3">

*January 2013:* I made this for a friend who was writing his own words to it.
Dunno if he ever finished recording it. This could still use some improvement.

</l-music>


# 2012


## *Mountains In Space*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Mountains In Space.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Mountains In Space.mp3">

*July 2012:* for the [Minecraft Space Mountain video].

</l-music>


## *Tiny World*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Tiny World.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Tiny World.mp3">

## *Death Error*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Death Error.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Death Error.mp3">

*April 2012:* For [Think Green].

</l-music>


## *Town Theme (orchestrated, draft)*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Town Theme (orchestrated, draft).ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Town Theme (orchestrated, draft).mp3">

*March 2012:* This is an orchestration of [Joey Franco's town theme], which was
originally written for piano. He's slightly upset because I messed up part of
the chord progression. In my defense, I'm still planning to fix it if I ever end
up working on this again.

</l-music>


## *The Game*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - The Game.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - The Game.mp3">

*March 2012:* This is a piano duet. [Sheet music](/files/sheets/the-game.pdf)
is available.

</l-music>


## *The Game (chiptune version)*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - The Game (chiptune version).ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - The Game (chiptune version).mp3">

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Exploding Soda Machine (Notion 3).ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Exploding Soda Machine (Notion 3).mp3">

*February 2012:* I was experimenting with the demo version of Notion 3. This is just a
re-creation of my earlier track *Exploding Soda Machine*.

</l-music>


## *battle music (rough draft)*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - battle music (rough draft).ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - battle music (rough draft).mp3">

## *The Village*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - The Village.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - The Village.mp3">

*August 2011*

</l-music>


## *The Shop*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - The Shop.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - The Shop.mp3">

*August 2011:* This actually doesn't sound at all like shop music. It sounds more like
credits or menu music.

</l-music>


## *Christmas In July*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Christmas In July.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Christmas In July.mp3">

*July 2011:* My first Christmas medley! Included tunes (in order of initial
appearance—some overlap):

* God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen
* The First Noel
* Il est né
* Sing We Now of Christmas
* Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming
* Up on the House Top
* Jingle Bells
* Do You Hear What I Hear?
* Look Down (Les Misérables)
* Carol of the Bells
* Ding Dong Merrily on High

</l-music>


## *experimental memphis*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - experimental memphis.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - experimental memphis.mp3">

*July 2011:* I tried this after listening to the soundtrack for *Memphis* (the
musical) a few times. I was just going for a sort of gospel-y feel, I guess.
This was tricky because the saxophone sample I was using only did short notes.

</l-music>


## *On The Clock (long version)*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - On The Clock (long version).ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - On The Clock (long version).mp3">

*June 2011:* This track is an extension of the older *On The Clock* that
matches up perfectly with Ke$ha's *Tik Tok*. The added build-up section that
starts about 2/3 of the way through is spiffy.

</l-music>


## *RandyRacer*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - RandyRacer.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - RandyRacer.mp3" src-flac="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - RandyRacer.flac">

*May 2011:* This is Randy Adams's theme song.

</l-music>


## *Les Misérables bows music loop*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Les Miserables bows music loop.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Les Miserables bows music loop.mp3">

*May 2011:* This really needs to be re-balanced. Too much bass and horn.

</l-music>


## *Contest Entry*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Contest Entry.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Contest Entry.mp3">

*April 2011:* Anthony Narciso, Jeffrey Narciso, and I had a contest to see who
could write the coolest track in an hour. We constrained ourselves thusly: (1)
must include a pitched instrument; (2) must include drums; (3) must be loudest
at the end. I gave myself the additional constraint that all of my layers needed
to sound good together. It turned out okay…

</l-music>


## *No Quest*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - No Quest.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - No Quest.mp3">

*March 2011*

</l-music>


## *Norman's Theme*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Norman's Theme.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Norman's Theme.mp3">

*March 2011*

## *Walkin' Lucas (He's a Fish)*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Walkin' Lucas (He's a Fish).ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Walkin' Lucas (He's a Fish).mp3">

*March 2011:* Written for David Troner's fish named Lucas. The ending (the last
17 or so seconds) is basically perfect.

</l-music>


# 2010


## *God Stress Ye, Merry Mentlegen*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - God Stress Ye, Merry Mentlegen.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - God Stress Ye, Merry Mentlegen.mp3">

*December 2010:* You don't think Christmas music can be annoying? Think again!

</l-music>


## *God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.mp3">

*December 2010:* As far as I can tell, this is the correct punctuation of the
title.  I wrote this in response to calzoneman's God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.
The ending explosion is the same as from *On The Clock*. It just sounded right.

</l-music>


## *Surrogate Melon*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Surrogate Melon.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Surrogate Melon.mp3">

*December 2010*

*June 2010:* No comment.

</l-music>


## *On The Clock*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - On The Clock.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - On The Clock.mp3">

*June 2010:* Written using the chords from Ke$ha's *Tik Tok*. I tried to hide
this fact until the point in the middle where it becomes completely obvious.

</l-music>


## *Latin Prepositions*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Latin Prepositions.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Latin Prepositions.mp3">

*January 2010:* Written for my high school Latin project. There's one obvious
mistake in this, where I say the wrong translation for "post montem". That was a
recording mistake that I didn't notice until it was too late to fix. Oh well.
I'm also not a big fan of my singing.

</l-music>


## *Latin Prepositions (vocoder mix)*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Latin Prepositions (vocoder mix).ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Latin Prepositions (vocoder mix).mp3">

## *Sing We Now Of Christmas*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Sing We Now Of Christmas.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Sing We Now Of Christmas.mp3">

*December 2009:* Just a chiptunified version of a standard four-part
arrangement—Not very exciting. I think I was experimenting with Milky Tracker.

</l-music>


## *Chocobo Minor*

<l-music src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Chocobo Minor.mp3">

## *cmbgmabb5*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - cmbgmabb5.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - cmbgmabb5.mp3">

*July 2009:* This is named after the chords that I used—except I messed up and
typed the wrong chords. "cmgmcmbflatcmgmaflatbflat" would be more accurate.

</l-music>


## *The Birthday Song*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - The Birthday Song.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - The Birthday Song.mp3">

## *Track 7*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Track 7.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Track 7.mp3">

*August 2006:* I was experimenting with using LSDJ (in an emulator) to create
the gameboy notes. Contains me awesomely saying a made-up word, "Fwazhoom!"

</l-music>


## *Find The Bass (Required)*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Find The Bass (Required).ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Find The Bass (Required).mp3">

## *Ultimate Banana Landscape*

<l-music src-ogg="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Ultimate Banana Landscape.ogg" src-mp3="/files/music/Synthmaster Lumpy - Ultimate Banana Landscape.mp3">

*June 2006:* This is clearly a parody of the Mario theme music.
