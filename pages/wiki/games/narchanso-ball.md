# NarChanSo Ball

**NarChanSo Ball** is a non-competitive team sport involving a playground ball and
a soccer goal. It was created by Colin Chan, Ian Chan, and Anthony Narciso in
the [early twenty-first century].

## Why NarChanSo Ball?

NarChanSo Ball is simple and flexible. It requires only two pieces of
equipment and can be played with both small and large numbers of players. Its
non-competitive nature allows for spontaneous team-shuffling and inclusion of
all players regardless of their athletic ability.

## Materials

*   A playground ball (rubber, preferably about 10 inches in diameter)
*   A large field with a soccer goal at one end (one half of a full-sized
    soccer field is ideal)

## Gameplay

A game of NarChanSo Ball consists of many short rounds. The players are
partitioned into two teams. For each round, one team is designated the
defensive team and the other the offensive team. Every round starts with the
two teams in their starting positions. The defensive team starts behind the
goal, punts the ball into the field from behind the goal, and then runs forward
to take position in the field. The offensive team starts in the field, receives
the kicked ball, and then moves toward the goal. The offensive team passes the
ball through the air as necessary to avoid the defense and attempts to throw
the ball into the goal. The round ends as soon as the ball touches the ground
or a defensive player tags the offensive player who is holding the ball.  Teams
then switch roles for the next round.

### Choosing teams

Teams should have roughly even numbers of players. As the game is
non-competitive, players may be shuffled between teams at any time.

### The round

The round begins at the moment an offensive player first touches the ball. The
round ends when any of the following occurs:

*   The ball touches the ground.
*   A member of the defense tags the person who is currently holding the ball.
*   The ball enters the goal.

Note that the ball is allowed to bounce on the ground before it has been
touched by a member of the offense, because at that point the round has not yet
begun.

The full procedure surrounding a round is as follows:

1.  Both teams assume their starting positions. The defensive team picks a
    kicker, who obtains the ball and stands behind the goal.
2.  The kicker asks the offense if they are ready and awaits affirmation.
3.  The kicker punts the ball over the goal into the field. At this point, the
    defense may move into the field.
4.  The offense grabs the ball and moves it toward the goal, typically by
    running and throwing passes between teammates, with the objective of
    throwing it into the goal. The defense tries to end the round by any of the
    means listed above.
5.  The round ends as explained above. If the round ended because the ball
    entered the goal, then the offense and defense retain their roles for the
    next round. In the other cases, the teams switch roles for the next round.

#### Starting positions

Members of the offense start anywhere on the field in front of the goal.
Members of the defense start anywhere behind (or in) the goal.

#### Tagging

Contacting a player with a single hand constitues a tag.

#### Re-kicking

If the offense determines that the ball was kicked too close to the goal or
that the defense ran onto the field too quickly to give the offense sufficient
starting space, they may request a re-kick.

### Scorekeeping

**No score or tally of the number of goals may be kept.** This rule is crucial to
maintaining the non-competitive nature of NarChanSo Ball.

## Tips and recommendations

### For offense

*   It is difficult to catch a ball that has been kicked very high. Let the
    ball bounce a couple of times before attempting to catch it.

### For defense

*   Give the offense enough room at the start of the round. Otherwise, they
    will probably ask for a re-kick.
