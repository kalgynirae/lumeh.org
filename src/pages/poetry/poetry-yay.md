# Poetry Yay

> Long, long ago up on top of a sign\
> Lived an old rotten sponge and a small piece of twine.\
> Said the sponge to the twine, “I am feeling quite fine.”\
> “But <span style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: wavy; text-decoration-color: red">youre</span> rotten, my friend,” said the small piece of twine.
>
> “That I am, that I am,” said the sponge to the twine.\
> “But I think you’ll find me in the prime of my time.\
> For I know when it’s wrong and when it is fine\
> To use an apostrophe.  You fail, Mr. Twine.”
